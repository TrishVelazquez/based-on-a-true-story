# based-on-a-true-story

Based On A True Story is user-driven Flask web application that lets users debate 
the “truthfulness” of a movie that is based on a "true story”. Based On A True Story 
integrates the Open Movie Database API to allow users to retrieve movies that fit 
the criteria of a "true story". Users can then submit "truths", comments, and replies 
about each movie and vote on the helpfulness of the submitted content, which 
encourages friendly & courteous user interaction. 

This full stack project was built with a Python back-end and a JavaScript front-end.
